# Filtering

Retis offers two distinct methods for filtering packets, both of which
can operate simultaneously:

- packet-based filtering which filters packets based on their content
  (headers).
- metadata-based filtering which filters packets based on their
  associated metadata.

These filtering mechanisms ensure that only relevant packets are
reported, so reducing the volume of uninteresting events and
improving the efficiency of packet tracing.

## Packet

Packet filtering uses a pcap-filter syntax. See `man pcap-filter` for an
overview on the syntax. Upon execution the pcap-filter gets compiled in cBPF
and subsequently translated into an eBPF program which in turn gets consumed by
the probes.

```none
$ retis collect -f 'tcp port 443'
...
```

Packet filtering can be of two types: L2 and L3. Retis automatically detects and
generates L2/L3 filters based on the expression. This allows to match both packets
fully formed and packets not having a valid L2 header yet (`sk_buff` having invalid
`mac_header` but valid and set `network_header`). One advantage of this approach is
the ability to match locally generated packets while still allowing matches based
on L2 criteria.

For example, the following filter:

```none
$ retis collect -f 'arp or tcp port 443'
L2+L3 packet filter(s) loaded
...
```

Internally generates two filters. For probes where only the `network_header`
is valid and set in the `sk_buff` the filter would match packets with tcp
source or destination port 443. For `sk_buff` with valid `mac_header` both arp
and tcp packets would be matched.
Please note that some limitations exist and they are a direct consequence of
libpcap capabilities.
For example filters like:

```none
$ retis collect -f 'ether broadcast or tcp port 443'
L2 packet filter(s) loaded
...
```

Will only generate L2 filters, that is, packets will be matched only if
`mac_header` is set.
For further information about the reason an L3 filter gets skipped, please
use the `--log-level debug` option, i.e.:

```none
$ retis --log-level debug collect -f 'ether broadcast or tcp port 443'
...
DEBUG Skipping L3 filter generation (Could not compile the filter: libpcap error: not a broadcast link).
INFO  L2 packet filter(s) loaded
...
```

## Metadata

Metadata filtering instead allows to write filters that match packets based
on their metadata.
These filters can match against any subfield of the `sk_buff` and subsequent
inner data structures.
Meta filtering also automatically follows struct pointers, so indirect access to
structures pointed by an `sk_buff` field is possible.
A filter expression is represented by the pseudo EBNF grammar below:

```none
EXPR ::= LHS ' ' OP_RHS | LHS
OP_RHS ::= OP ' ' RHS_NUM | EQ_NE ' ' RHS_STR
LHS ::= 'sk_buff' MEMBER
MEMBER ::= NEXTIDENT MEMBER | NEXTIDENT
NEXTIDENT ::= '.' IDENT (':' MASK (':' IDENT)?)?
IDENT ::= #'[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*'
OP ::= EQ_NE | '<' | '<=' | '>' | '>='
EQ_NE ::= '==' | '!='
MASK ::= ('~')? MASK_NUM
MASK_NUM ::= HEX | DEC | BIN
RHS_STR ::= '"' ASCII '"' | '\'' ASCII '\''
ASCII ::= #'[:ascii:]*'
RHS_NUM ::= HEX | ('-')? DEC
HEX ::= #'0x[a-fA-F0-9]+'
DEC ::= #'[0-9]+'
BIN ::= #'0b[0-1]+'
```

An example of filter that respect a previous definition is:

```none
$ retis collect -m 'sk_buff.dev.nd_net.net.ns.inum == 4026531840'
...
```

The comparison operators are:

1. "==" for *equal to*
2. "!=" for *not equal to*
3. "<" and "<=" for *less than* and *less than or equal to*
4. ">" and ">=" for *greater than* and *greater than or equal to*
5. if OP and RHS are omitted, a *not equal to* zero numeric comparison is assumed

At the moment, only number and string comparisons are supported.
The right-hand side (rhs) of numeric matches must be expressed as
literal and can be represented in either base 10 or base 16, with the
latter starting with `0x` prefix.
All the comparison operators support numbers (both signed and unsigned).
Bitfields are supported as well (both signed and unsigned) and they
are treated as regular numbers.
For numeric comparisons, an additional bitwise AND operation can be
performed by specifying a *mask*.
A *mask* can be expressed as a hexadecimal number (e.g. *0xdeaf*), a
binary number (e.g. *0b01010101*), and a regular decimal number.
The filtering engine allows you to specify masks up to **u64::MAX**
with any target. While this approach is safe, ensuring consistency is
the user's responsibility.
The following example demonstrates this approach:

```
$ retis collect -m 'sk_buff._nfct:0x7 == 0x2'
...
```

which is equivalent to the following:

```none
(sk_buff->_nfct & NFCT_INFOMASK) == IP_CT_NEW
```

For strings only the operators *equal to* and *not equal to* are supported,
furthermore, the string (rhs) must be enclosed between *quotes*.

```none
$ retis collect -m 'sk_buff.dev.name == "eth0"'
...
```

The example above shows how strings can be matched and how they are
required to be quoted.

Another useful feature meta filtering expose is the ability to follow
pointers embedded in members with a different defined type.
For example, the filter below:

```none
$ retis collect -m sk_buff._nfct:~0x7:nf_conn.mark
...
```

is equivalent to the following:

```none
((struct nf_conn *)(skb->_nfct & NFCT_PTRMASK))->mark != 0
```

Metadata filtering, being a BTF-based way of filtering, is theoretically
not limited to `sk_buff`, so from a generic point of view it can support
all filters under the form *struct_type_name.field1.field2.field3* with
the above constraints, but for the time being only `struct sk_buff` is
supported.
This implies that the `sk_buff` keyword **MUST** always be present and **MUST**
always appear first.

It is possible to combine packet and meta filtering, and doing so is just a
matter of specifying their respective options and filters.

```none
$ retis collect -f 'tcp port 443' -m 'sk_buff.dev.name == "eth0"'
...
```

The above options will be concatenated, meaning that both filters must match
in order to have a match and generate events for packets.

Meta filtering has some known limitations, in particular only one
field at the time can be matched.
